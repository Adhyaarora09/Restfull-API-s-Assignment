        "1Que: What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: REST APIs are an essential part of modern web development. They are used to enable communication between different systems, devices, and applications. REST APIs use HTTP to communicate between the client and the server. They use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform various operations like fetching data, creating data, updating data, and deleting data. Python is a popular programming language that can be used to interact with REST APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "REST APIs are a type of web service that is used to create APIs using the REST architectural style. These are lightweight and can be accessed using HTTP requests. REST APIs have become popular because they are scalable, stateless, and simple to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2Que: Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It is used to standardize data exchange between web services. Standardize means the ability of diverse systems, written in different programming languages, to run on different operating systems, or use various technologies to communicate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The API specification provides a comprehensive understanding of how an API behaves and links with other APIs. It also explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are four types of API specifications:\n",
        "\n",
        "Representational State Transfer (REST).\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).\n",
        "\n",
        "GraphQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remote Procedure Call (RPC).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "REST:\n",
        "\n",
        "REST API is one of the most common specifications of API. REST APIs allow you to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations between a client and a server. It connects your backend with your frontend so they can communicate with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "SOAP:\n",
        "\n",
        "SOAP API is another type of web service that allows communication between client and server. Any web service that complies with the SOAP web services specification is a SOAP web service. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is behind these specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "GraphQL:\n",
        "\n",
        "The GraphQL API is designed to provide you with the precise amount of data you request. With the REST API, you often encounter the problem of over-fetching and under-fetching, and GraphQL solves these problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "RPC:\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a simple interaction where a local client sends commands to a remote server. Both client and server use different call parameters, and these parameters are converted on both sides. These conversions happen through stubs that are dedicated pieces of code responsible for transforming and deconverting the call function parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3Que: What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Flask is a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python. It’s often called a \"micro-framework\" because it provides the essentials for web development without unnecessary complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4Que: What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: App Routing means mapping the URLs to a specific function that will handle the logic for that URL. Modern web frameworks use more meaningful URLs to help users remember the URLs and make navigation simpler.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In our application, the URL (\"/\") is associated with the root URL. So if our site's domain was www.example.org and we want to add routing to \"www.example.org/hello\", we would use \"/hello\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To bind a function to an URL path we use the app.route decorator. In the below example, we have implemented the above routing in the flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pass the required route to the decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route(\"/hello\")\n",
        "\n",
        "def hello():\n",
        "\n",
        "    return \"Hello, Welcome to GeeksForGeeks\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
        "\n",
        "def index():\n",
        "\n",
        "    return \"Homepage of GeeksForGeeks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
        "\n",
        "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5Que: How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Build Your First Flask Application:\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 1: Create a Project Directory:\n",
        "\n",
        "To start with, we need to create a directory for our Flask project. This directory will contain all the files and folders related to our Flask application. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following command to create a new directory for your Flask project:\n",
        "\n",
        "mkdir pythongeeks\n",
        "\n",
        "You can replace “pythongeeks” with the name you prefer for your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment:\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Flask project to isolate its dependencies from the system-wide Python installation. If you have not created a virtual environment for your Flask project yet, you can follow the instructions in our previous article on Flask environment setup to create one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Activate your virtual environment before proceeding to the next steps. On Mac and Linux, you can run the following command:\n",
        "\n",
        "source pythongeeks/bin/activate\n",
        "On Windows, you can run the following command:\n",
        "\n",
        "pythongeeks\\bin\\activate\n",
        "Make sure to replace “pythongeeks” with the name of your virtual environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 3: Install Flask:\n",
        "\n",
        "With your virtual environment activated, you can now install Flask. Run the following command to install Flask using pip:\n",
        "\n",
        "pip install Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 4: Create a Flask Application:\n",
        "\n",
        "Now it’s time to create our first Flask application. In the directory of your Flask project, create a new file named app.py. This will be the main file where we will write our Flask application code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open app.py in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, and let’s start writing our Flask application code.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we need to import the Flask module and create an instance of the Flask class, which will represent our web application. Here’s an example of how you can do it:\n",
        "\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "In the code above, we imported the Flask module and created an instance of the Flask class named app. We passed __name__ as an argument to the Flask class, which is a special variable in Python that represents the name of the current module. This allows Flask to determine the root path of our application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 5: Define Routes:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Flask, routes define the URLs that our web application can handle. When a user requests a URL, Flask maps it to a specific route function, which then handles the request and generates a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s define our first route. Below the app instance creation code, add the following route function:\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def hello():\n",
        "   return 'Hello, Pythongeeks!'\n",
        "In the code above, we used the route decorator provided by Flask to define a route for the root URL (“/”) of our web application. The route function hello() is a Python function that will be called when a user accesses the root URL of our application. The function simply returns the string “Hello, Pythongeeks!” as the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 6: Run the Flask Application:\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have defined our first route, let’s run our Flask application and see it in action. In your terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the directory of your Flask project where app.py is located. Then, run the following command:\n",
        "\n",
        "python app.py\n",
        "This will start the Flask development server and make your application accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should see the message “Hello, Pythongeeks!” displayed in your browser, indicating that your Flask application is up and running!\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 7: Handling Requests and Responses\n",
        "In our previous step, we saw how to define a route and generate a simple response. But web applications are all about handling different types of requests and generating appropriate responses. Let’s explore how we can handle different types of HTTP requests in Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "6Que: What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: GET - \tRetrieve an existing resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "POST -\tCreate a new resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "PUT -\tUpdate an existing resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "PATCH\t - Partially update an existing resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE - \tDelete a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "A REST API client application can use these five HTTP methods to manage the state of resources in the web service.\n",
        "\n",
        "7Que: What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The route() decorator, @app.route(), binds a URL to a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want the route /hello, you can bind it to the hello_world() function like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/hello')\n",
        "\n",
        "def hello_world():\n",
        "\n",
        "   return \"hello world\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of the function hello_world() is shown in your browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "8Que: What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The main difference between GET and POST requests is the way data is sent to the server. GET requests send data in the URL’s query string, while POST requests send data in the request body. GET requests are used for retrieving data, while POST requests are used for submitting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9Que: How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Applications fail, servers fail. Sooner or later you will see an exception in production. Even if your code is 100% correct, you will still see exceptions from time to time. Why? Because everything else involved will fail. Here are some situations where perfectly fine code can lead to server errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "the client terminated the request early and the application was still reading from the incoming data\n",
        "\n",
        "the database server was overloaded and could not handle the query\n",
        "\n",
        "a filesystem is full.\n",
        "\n",
        "a harddrive crashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "a backend server overloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "a programming error in a library you are using.\n",
        "\n",
        "network connection of the server to another system failed.\n",
        "\n",
        "10Que: How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Step 1 — Installing Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, you’ll install the necessary packages for your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "With your virtual environment activated, use pip to install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "\n",
        "pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the installation is successfully finished, you’ll see a line similar to the following at the end of the output:\n",

        "With the required Python packages installed, you’ll set up the database next.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2 — Setting up the Database and Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, you’ll set up your database connection, and create an SQLAlchemy database model, which is a Python class that represents the table that stores your data. You’ll initiate the database, create a table for students based on the model you’ll declare, and add a few students into your students table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting up The Database Connection:\n",
        "\n",
        "Open a file called app.py in your flask_app directory. This file will have code for setting up the database and your Flask routes:\n",
        "\n",
        "nano app.py:\n",

        "\n",
        "From the flask package, you then import the necessary helpers you need for your application: the Flask class to create a Flask application instance, the render_template() function to render templates, the request object to handle requests, the url_for() function to construct URLs for routes, and the redirect() function for redirecting users. For more information on routes and templates, see How To Use Templates in a Flask Application.\n",
        "\n",
        "You then import the SQLAlchemy class from the Flask-\n",
        "\n",
        "SQLAlchemy extension, which gives you access to all the functions and classes from SQLAlchemy, in addition to helpers, and functionality that integrates Flask with SQLAlchemy. You’ll use it to create a database object that connects to your Flask application, allowing you to create and manipulate tables using Python classes, objects, and functions without needing to use the SQL language.\n",
        "\n",
        "You also import the func helper from the sqlalchemy.sql module to access SQL functions. You’ll need it in your student management system to set a default creation date and time for when a student record is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below the imports, you’ll set up a database file path, instantiate your Flask application, and configure and connect your application with SQLAlchemy. Add the following code:\n",

        "\n",
        "12Que:  What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Blueprints in Flask help you organize your application into modular, reusable components. They let you group related routes, templates, and static files together, which is especially useful for large projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "13Que: What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In a Flask App, we have our own Webpage (Client) and a Server. The Server should process the data.  The Request, in Flask, is an object that contains all the data sent from the Client to Server. This data can be recovered using the GET/POST Methods. POST is used when your application expects user input to be received by command or an HTTP request, while GET gets all the information before it even has a chance for submission. Using both methods at once gives perfect freedom but still requires complex UI patterns like AJAX calls etc, with most common applications being frameworks where multiple forms are necessary such as Slack Webhooks, MailgunMailserver, and eCommerce Commerce Framework. With Flask-Request class instead, we don't have any need anymore since this API allows us flexible handling of many other situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various attributes associated with the request objects. They are Form, Cookies, Args, Files, and Method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The form is used to create and return the form data from other application codes like JSP API or POST. This attribute allows you to specify predefined custom parameters when creating HTTP requests for your service (like \"GET /info\" ) which can be given as string values without any format validation etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cookies property contains cookie contents that will allow the client to access a piece of information about users' details through the Cookie header field of returned JSON Object Content Type Information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Args is used to initialize a Request constructor which you have given as a parameter of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Files are used to refer to file data stored in the user's cookies (whereas a method is an HTTP API for accessing those files). Actions can be chained together so as far it goes you will need different Actions when calling other methods by default like POST /items/:id or GET /API. So if we want to add multiple items to the item list then there must also be some additional actions on both end-points that do something similar and which cannot be handled easily using form objects alone - eg create a new \"form\" from existing ones, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method is used to create a new form element or an existing one via custom URL configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us consider the below example of Retrieving user entered form data from Webpage and Displaying it on another web page. This Requires 3 files - app.py (Main Python File), Temp.html (That contains the Form), and result_data.html (That displays the Output). You should make sure all other required libraries have been installed for this example in order not to run out of namespaces. In the main route, we just render the Temp.html file. The HTML File contains a form that asks for Name, Email, and Phone Number. Once Submit button is pressed, it returns to /passing route in python, which processes the Form if the method is POST. The flask Request Method had two options - POST and GET, using which form data can be processed/Retrieved.  Request.form is used to execute a batch of requests, such as checking if the user has provided any password when requested by calling display(). This method will return an object containing information about each request made during that time (whereas Requests.listing returns only objects from matching filters). Request.form is used to render the requested text in JSON format, as it allows you to use multiple forms of presentation for different content types such as emails, links, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14Que: How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: API endpoints are the URLs that your API clients will use to interact with your application. In Flask, you can define endpoints using route decorators. For example, to create an endpoint for retrieving a list of items, you can do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])\n",
        "\n",
        "def get_items():\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Retrieve and return a list of items from your database\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15Que: What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",

        "\n",
        "Authentication and Authorization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Token-based Authentication (e.g., JWT): This is a common and effective method. Users authenticate once (e.g., with username/password) to receive a token, which is then sent with subsequent API requests for validation. Libraries like Flask-JWT-Extended simplify this.\n",
        "\n",
        "OAuth2: For more complex scenarios involving third-party applications, OAuth2 can be used for delegated authorization, allowing users to grant limited access to their data without sharing credentials directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement roles and permissions to control what specific users or groups can access or modify within the API. Libraries like Flask-Security-Too can help manage users, roles, and permissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Protection:\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTPS/TLS: Encrypt all communication between the API and clients using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is typically handled by a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Apache) in front of your Flask application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secure Secret Key Management: Use a strong, randomly generated secret key for your Flask application and store it securely (e.g., environment variables, encrypted configuration files) to prevent unauthorized access. Never commit it directly to version control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Encryption at Rest: If storing sensitive data in a database, ensure it is encrypted at rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input Validation and Sanitization:\n",
        "Prevent Injection Attacks: Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other injection vulnerabilities.\n",

        "Limit Request Body Size: Prevent denial-of-service attacks by limiting the size of incoming request bodies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling and Logging:\n",
        "Generic Error Messages: Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Provide generic error responses for failed requests.\n",
        "Comprehensive Logging: Implement robust logging to track API access, errors, and potential security incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rate Limiting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevent Brute-Force and DoS Attacks: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given timeframe, preventing brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints and mitigating denial-of-service attempts.\n",

        "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):\n",
        "\n",
        "Control Access from Other Domains: Configure CORS headers carefully to specify which origins are allowed to access your API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.\n",
